Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- Hi, I'm Brad.
- I hold a PhD in Mathematics (Florida State University, May 2023). My dissertation concerned modelling insider trading in the stock market using a continuous time Kyle-Back model with stochastic liquidity.
- I am an adept programmer with significant expertise within Python and additional full-stack programming skills (Javascript/HTML/CSS, react.js, next.js, RESTful APIs, GraphQL, MERN stack, Flask backends)
- I enjoy challenging environments which require working in the unknown and learning/mastering new concepts on the fly.
